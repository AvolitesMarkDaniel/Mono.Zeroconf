Ideally the Avahi provider would just use DBus instead of avahi-sharp.

Using avahi-sharp:

	[Application]     (managed)
	[Mono.Zeroconf]   (managed)
	[avahi-sharp]     (managed p/invoke binding)
	[libavahi-client] (native)
	[libdbus]         (native)
		  ..          (DBus IPC)
	[avahi-daemon]    (native)

Using DBus:

	[Application]     (managed)
	[Mono.Zeroconf]   (managed)
	[NDesk.DBus]      (managed)
		  ..          (DBus IPC)
	[avahi-daemon]    (native)

However, due to some poor design decisions in the Avahi DBus API,
implementing the provider via DBus is not currently possible without
exposing the need for the application to use DBus.

The DBus provider for Avahi will be resumed later. For now the
avahi-sharp binding provider will have to do.
