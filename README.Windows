To run Mono.Zeroconf properly on Windows, Apple's Bonjour must be installed
first. For licensing reasons, we cannot bundle Bonjour with Mono.Zeroconf.

Bonjour for Windows can be downloaded here:

After installing Bonjour, applications using Mono.Zeroconf should work 
properly on Windows. 

The MZClient.exe program can be used to test Mono.Zeroconf and Bonjour 
in general.
