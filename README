Mono.Zeroconf is a cross platform Zero Configuration Networking library 
for .NET. It provides a unified API for performing the most common zeroconf 
operations while supporting multiple underlying zeroconf subsystems like 
Bonjour/mDNSResponder and Avahi.

By default, Mono.Zeroconf includes support for both mDNSResponder and Avahi,
though it is possible to write new providers for Mono.Zeroconf, which are
just plugins to the Mono.Zeroconf system.

More information about Mono.Zeroconf can be found on its project 
page on the Mono Wiki:
